# Data_warehouse_tech_stack_with_PostgreSQL_DBT_Airflow
the data warehouse techstack is built based on pNEUMA which is an open large-scale dataset of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles that have been collected by a one-of-a-kind experiment by a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece. 
# objectives 
To establish a scalable data infrastructure, leveraging AI-driven analysis of swarm UAV footage and static cameras, to collect and manage vehicle trajectory data. This infrastructure aims to support the city's traffic department in optimizing traffic flow and facilitating undisclosed projects by utilizing comprehensive, real-time data insights gathered from a city locations.
